# Building a SOC + Honeynet in Azure (Live Traffic)

## Introduction

In this project, I created a mini honeynet within Azure and collected log data from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. This workspace was then utilized by Microsoft Sentinel to construct attack maps, trigger alerts, and generate incidents. Initially, I measured specific security metrics in an unprotected environment for 24 hours. Afterward, I implemented security controls to strengthen the environment and recorded the metrics again for another 24 hours. The metrics presented below include:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Alerts triggered within Log Analytics)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents generated by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious traffic allowed into the honeynet)

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

"BEFORE" metrics: all resources were deployed and exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls fully open, and all other resources were deployed with public endpoints accessible from the Internet. Private Endpoints were not utilized.

"AFTER" metrics: to improve security, Network Security Groups were configured to block all traffic except from my admin workstation. Additionally, all other resources were secured using their built-in firewalls and Private Endpoints.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2024-07-15 17:00:21 
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 21313
| Syslog                   | 14382
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 219
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 2207

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastically reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
